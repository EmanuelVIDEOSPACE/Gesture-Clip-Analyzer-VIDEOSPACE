Gesture Clip Analyzer by VIDEOSPACE is an iOS app that detects gestures in video clips with AI and exports a markers.json file with timecodes and labels. Used in AI video post-production, it integrates with our Adobe Premiere Pro Beta 25.4 UXP panel for automatic marker placement and smart clip cutting.
