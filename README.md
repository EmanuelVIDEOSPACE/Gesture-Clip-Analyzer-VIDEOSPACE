# Gesture Clip Analyzer â€” by VIDEOSPACE

**Gesture Clip Analyzer** is a **macOS** desktop app (Python: PySide6 + OpenCV) for analyzing MP4 files and detecting **when a gesture/movement occurs**.  
It exports a structured **`markers.json`** with precise timecodes, labels, and (optionally) durations. This file is then imported into Adobe Premiere Pro via our UXP panel **GestureMarkers_UXP** to place markers for cut clips automatically.

> VIDEOSPACE uses this tool in production for **AI-driven video post-production** (gesture-based editing, voiceover sync, fast rough-cut).
